<p>One form of visualizing our data is by the scatterplot. In the 9:00am intro class, we worked on making scatter plots in RStudio, running a query searching for players with at least 400 career homeruns</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Extractcing Data----------------------------

query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR ,sum(SO) AS career_SO 
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)&gt;=400&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)

#Visulaizing Data----------------------------

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=3, color=&quot;blue&quot;)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Career Strikeouts vs. Homeruns for Great Hitters&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Career Strikeouts&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Career Homerunes&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above, we assigned the output of the query to the variable ‘result’, storing it for later use. We then ran the code to make a scatter plot with Career Strikeouts at the X-Axis and Career Homeruns as the Y-Axis, as well as using size 3 blue points.</p>
